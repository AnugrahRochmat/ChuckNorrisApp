# ChuckNorrisApp
I found this API https://api.chucknorris.io/ and thinking to play with.
While i'm still learning and keen to improve my skill as an Android Developer so i'm gonna to make this app for android devices.

The idea is i'm trying to utilize all the thing that i can get from this API and added some simple feature into this app.

## Version 1.0
Utilizes all the thing i can get from API.
In the future i would like to add slider to pick background image for the jokes.
